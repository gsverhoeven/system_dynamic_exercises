## Day 1 Introduction

Video TU Delft on System Dynamics: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLZEhAuYFZQ

Reading: Introduction to System dynamics (Duggan 2016)

Exercises:

* Run [Tutorial notebook](day1/introduction.Rmd), creating SD models in R
* do exercises in this notebook:
    * including Hardware sales model (Vensim)
    * and numerical integration


## Day 2 The SD zoo (Meadows Chapter 2)

Read chapter 2 from Meadows 2008, Thinking in systems, A primer.
Freely available online as PDF or order from e.g. Amazon.

Examine example code and make exercises 1 and 2 in the [R notebook for day 2](day2/delays.Rmd)

* Baththub
* Thermostat
* Business Inventory
* Your own model with a delay

## Day 3 Limits to Growth (Duggan ch 3)

Exercise: Make "experienced programmer exercise"

## Day 4 "inverse modelling"

Fitting a model to data (FME)

## Day 5 alternative approaches

agent based modeling vs system dynamics vs microsimulation (DES, discrete event simulation)
